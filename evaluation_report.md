# Evaluation Report: DRL Autonomous Driving with Trust-Based Adaptation

## 1. Background

Autonomous driving technology has made remarkable progress in recent years, yet one of the most significant challenges to widespread adoption remains building and maintaining human trust in these systems. This project explores the intersection of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and trust-adaptive behavior in autonomous vehicles, addressing the critical need for vehicles that can dynamically adjust their driving style based on trust signals from passengers.

Trust in automated systems is complex and multifaceted, influenced by factors such as system performance, transparency, predictability, and alignment with user expectations. In the context of autonomous vehicles, trust directly impacts user acceptance, comfort, and willingness to cede control. When trust is low, users tend to intervene frequently, undermining the benefits of automation; conversely, excessive trust can lead to complacency and reduced situation awareness.

The concept of trust-based adaptation introduces a promising approach where autonomous vehicles actively monitor trust levels and adjust their behavior accordingly. For instance, when trust is low, the system might adopt more conservative driving patterns with slower speeds and greater following distances; as trust builds, the system can gradually adopt more efficient driving styles while maintaining safety.

Deep reinforcement learning offers a compelling framework for implementing trust-adaptive behavior. DRL agents can learn complex policies through interaction with their environment, optimizing for long-term rewards that balance multiple objectives including safety, efficiency, and trust-building. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, DRL approaches can discover nuanced relationships between driving actions and human trust responses, leading to more naturalistic and effective adaptation.

This project addresses several key research questions:

1. How can deep reinforcement learning be effectively applied to develop autonomous driving policies that adapt to human trust levels?

2. What observation space and reward structure best captures the complexity of trust-adaptive driving?

3. How do different DRL algorithms (PPO, SAC, etc.) perform in learning trust-adaptive behavior?

4. Does trust-based adaptation lead to measurable improvements in driving performance and user experience compared to non-adaptive approaches?

5. What are the limitations and challenges in implementing trust-adaptive driving in realistic simulation environments?

By exploring these questions within the CARLA simulation environment, this project aims to advance the field of human-AI interaction in autonomous driving, developing frameworks that may eventually translate to real-world autonomous systems that better respond to and cultivate human trust.

## 2. Methods

This section describes our methodological approach to developing and evaluating a trust-adaptive autonomous driving system using deep reinforcement learning techniques.

### 2.1 CARLA Environment Setup

We utilized the CARLA (Car Learning to Act) simulator, an open-source platform for autonomous driving research that provides realistic urban environments with detailed physics and sensory simulation. Within this environment, we developed a path following task as our primary navigation challenge. In this task, the autonomous agent must follow a sequence of waypoints that define a desired trajectory while maintaining appropriate speed, avoiding obstacles, and exhibiting human-compatible driving behavior.

The path following task presents several key challenges:
- Continuous control of both steering and acceleration/braking
- Dynamic speed regulation based on road conditions and trust levels
- Smooth trajectory tracking with minimal deviation
- Obstacle avoidance while maintaining the desired path
- Decision-making at intersections and other critical points

This task was chosen because it represents a fundamental autonomous driving capability that directly impacts passenger comfort and trust. By focusing on path following, we could directly measure the relationship between driving performance metrics (path deviation, speed compliance, smoothness) and simulated passenger trust.

### 2.2 Scenarios

To evaluate the agent's performance across different driving conditions, we implemented four distinct scenarios:

1. **Lane Switching**: This scenario requires the agent to navigate between lanes on a multi-lane highway, testing its ability to perform smooth transitions while maintaining appropriate following distances from other vehicles. The scenario evaluates the agent's capability to plan and execute lateral movements while maintaining longitudinal control.

2. **Urban Traffic**: Set in a dense urban environment with intersections, traffic lights, and numerous vehicles and pedestrians, this scenario tests the agent's ability to navigate complex traffic patterns. The agent must respond appropriately to traffic signals, yield to pedestrians, and maintain safe distances from other vehicles while following its designated path.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance**: This scenario places static and dynamic obstacles along the agent's path, requiring detection and evasive maneuvers. The scenario tests the agent's ability to balance path following with safety constraints, potentially requiring temporary deviations from the optimal path to avoid collisions.

4. **Emergency Braking**: Testing the agent's responsiveness to sudden hazards, this scenario evaluates the capacity for rapid deceleration when unexpected obstacles appear. The scenario measures reaction time, stopping distance, and the smoothness of emergency maneuvers.

These scenarios were designed to cover a broad spectrum of driving situations, ensuring that the trust adaptation mechanisms would be tested across varying levels of complexity and risk.

### 2.3 Observation Space

The observation space was designed to provide the agent with sufficient information about its environment, current state, and historical context to make informed decisions. We structured the observation space as a multi-modal representation with four key components:

1. **Vehicle State**: Information about the vehicle's current dynamics, including position, velocity, acceleration, heading angle, and angular velocity. This component also includes information about upcoming waypoints and the current trust level, allowing the agent to adapt its behavior based on both navigational requirements and trust considerations.

2. **Location History**: A sequence of past vehicle positions, providing temporal context about the trajectory that has been followed. This history allows the agent to infer its own movement patterns and maintain consistent behavior.

3. **Action History**: A record of recent control actions (steering and throttle/brake), enabling the agent to understand its own control patterns and maintain smooth transitions between actions.

4. **Environmental Information**: Radar-based obstacle detection providing distance measurements to surrounding objects at various angles, allowing the agent to perceive and respond to potential hazards in its environment.

This observation structure combines instantaneous state information with historical context and environmental perception, providing a comprehensive view of the driving situation that supports both navigational decision-making and trust-aware behavior adaptation.

### 2.4 Action Space

The agent's action space was designed to provide direct control over the vehicle's primary control mechanisms:

1. **Steering Control**: Continuous values in the range [-1.0, 1.0], corresponding to full left turn through full right turn.

2. **Throttle/Brake Control**: Continuous values in the range [-1.0, 1.0], where positive values apply throttle and negative values apply braking force.

This two-dimensional continuous action space allows the agent to develop nuanced control policies that can balance multiple objectives, including path following accuracy, ride comfort, and trust-building. The continuous nature of the action space enables smooth transitions between control states, supporting the development of naturalistic driving behaviors.

### 2.5 Reward Structure

We developed a multi-component reward function to guide the learning process toward behaviors that balance driving performance with trust maintenance. The reward function includes:

1. **Path Following**: Rewards the vehicle for adhering to the prescribed path, calculated using the alignment between the vehicle's velocity vector and the path direction. This component encourages accurate trajectory tracking.

2. **Progress**: Encourages appropriate speed maintenance relative to the target speed, which itself is modulated by trust levels. This component balances forward progress with adherence to trust-appropriate speeds.

3. **Safety**: Provides negative reinforcement for collisions, near-misses, and other safety violations, ensuring that the agent prioritizes collision avoidance even while pursuing other objectives.

4. **Comfort**: Rewards smooth driving by penalizing large accelerations, abrupt braking, and jerky steering actions. This component directly relates to passenger comfort, a key factor in trust development.

5. **Trust Maintenance**: Directly incorporates the trust level as a reward signal, encouraging the agent to maintain high trust levels through appropriate driving behavior.

6. **Intervention Mitigation**: Applies penalties when human interventions occur, teaching the agent to avoid behaviors that might prompt passenger intervention.

These reward components are combined with configurable weights, allowing us to experiment with different prioritizations of performance versus trust objectives. By incorporating both immediate driving performance metrics and trust-related factors, the reward function guides the agent toward behaviors that not only achieve the navigation task but do so in a manner that builds and maintains human trust.

### 2.6 Trust Adaptation Logic

The core innovation in our approach is the trust adaptation mechanism, which models the dynamic relationship between driving behavior and passenger trust. This mechanism operates through several interconnected components:

1. **Trust Modeling**: We model trust as a continuous value between 0.0 (no trust) and 1.0 (complete trust), which evolves based on driving behavior metrics and passenger interventions. The trust model incorporates:
   - Driving quality metrics (steering stability, acceleration smoothness, speed compliance)
   - Intervention history (frequency and recency of manual interventions)
   - Context-aware factors (e.g., behavior near decision points like intersections)

2. **Behavior Adaptation**: As trust levels change, the agent's behavior is adapted in several ways:
   - **Speed Adaptation**: Target speeds are adjusted based on trust, with lower trust levels resulting in more conservative (slower) target speeds.
   - **Action Adjustment**: The magnitude and smoothness of control actions are modulated based on trust, with low trust leading to gentler steering and acceleration/deceleration.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: The agent's willingness to make assertive maneuvers (e.g., lane changes, overtaking) decreases with lower trust levels.

3. **Intervention Learning**: The system learns from human interventions, treating them as important learning signals that indicate undesirable behavior. These interventions directly impact trust levels and provide strong negative reinforcement in the learning process.

This trust adaptation logic creates a feedback loop where the agent's actions influence trust, trust levels influence subsequent behavior adaptations, and these adaptations in turn affect future trust development. Through reinforcement learning, the agent discovers behavior policies that maintain high trust levels while still achieving its navigation objectives effectively.

### 2.7 Learning Approach

We employed Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, as our primary learning method. PPO was selected for its sample efficiency, stability, and effectiveness in continuous control tasks. The algorithm optimizes a neural network policy that maps from the multi-modal observation space to the continuous action space.

The learning process incorporated several techniques to improve training effectiveness:
- Reward shaping to provide more informative learning signals
- Curriculum learning, gradually increasing scenario difficulty
- Experience replay to improve sample efficiency
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize learning rate, batch size, and policy update frequency

Through this learning approach, the agent developed driving policies that adapt to changing trust levels while maintaining effective path following capabilities across our test scenarios.

## 3. Experiment

We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate our trust-adaptive autonomous driving approach across different scenarios and trust conditions. The experiments focused on systematically testing how fixed trust levels affect driving behavior and performance.

### 3.1 Experimental Design

Our experimental design included:
- Testing each scenario (Lane Switching, Urban Traffic, Obstacle Avoidance, and Emergency Braking) with five fixed trust levels: 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0
- Running 20 episodes per trust level per scenario
- Maintaining consistent environmental conditions within each scenario type
- Collecting standardized metrics across all trials for comparative analysis

This approach allowed us to isolate the impact of trust level on driving behavior without the complexity of dynamic trust evolution, providing a clear baseline for understanding trust-adaptation effects.

### 3.2 Performance Metrics

For each trial, we measured:
- Path following accuracy (average deviation from optimal path)
