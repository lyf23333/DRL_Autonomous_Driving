# Evaluation Report: DRL Autonomous Driving with Trust-Based Adaptation

## 1. Background

Autonomous driving technology has made remarkable progress in recent years, yet one of the most significant challenges to widespread adoption remains building and maintaining human trust in these systems. This project explores the intersection of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and trust-adaptive behavior in autonomous vehicles, addressing the critical need for vehicles that can dynamically adjust their driving style based on trust signals from passengers.

Trust in automated systems is complex and multifaceted, influenced by factors such as system performance, transparency, predictability, and alignment with user expectations. In the context of autonomous vehicles, trust directly impacts user acceptance, comfort, and willingness to cede control. When trust is low, users tend to intervene frequently, undermining the benefits of automation; conversely, excessive trust can lead to complacency and reduced situation awareness.

The concept of trust-based adaptation introduces a promising approach where autonomous vehicles actively monitor trust levels and adjust their behavior accordingly. For instance, when trust is low, the system might adopt more conservative driving patterns with slower speeds and greater following distances; as trust builds, the system can gradually adopt more efficient driving styles while maintaining safety.

Deep reinforcement learning offers a compelling framework for implementing trust-adaptive behavior. DRL agents can learn complex policies through interaction with their environment, optimizing for long-term rewards that balance multiple objectives including safety, efficiency, and trust-building. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, DRL approaches can discover nuanced relationships between driving actions and human trust responses, leading to more naturalistic and effective adaptation.

This project addresses several key research questions:

1. How can deep reinforcement learning be effectively applied to develop autonomous driving policies that adapt to human trust levels?

2. What observation space and reward structure best captures the complexity of trust-adaptive driving?

3. How do different DRL algorithms (PPO, SAC, etc.) perform in learning trust-adaptive behavior?

4. Does trust-based adaptation lead to measurable improvements in driving performance and user experience compared to non-adaptive approaches?

5. What are the limitations and challenges in implementing trust-adaptive driving in realistic simulation environments?

By exploring these questions within the CARLA simulation environment, this project aims to advance the field of human-AI interaction in autonomous driving, developing frameworks that may eventually translate to real-world autonomous systems that better respond to and cultivate human trust.
